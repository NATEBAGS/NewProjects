# My Projects - Nathaniel Bagchee

## Python Projects
* Several manual and sklearn implementations of Perceptron, Naive Bayes, KMeans/GMM
* Neural Network Backpropagation for a simple neural network
* Blackjack Simulator to simulate the effectiveness of a specific online AI blackjack card counter, can be used to test other strategies as well
* A small neural language model (MLP)
  - Uses nltk library to load corpuses for training/validation/test data
  - Creates embeddings for words (how similar/correlated words are to each other)
  - Predicts the next word from the previous two words embeddings
  - Generates random sentences based on what the model learned during training
## Swift Project
* Contributed to a spend management software project for iOS devices, below are the things that I built for the project:
  - Created ways for users to sign in (email/password or Google) and have their data attached to their user profile
  - Implemented a way to crop images and zoom in/out of images
  - Built a way extract the text using OCR and then created regex parsing rules to parse the date, store name, and totals from reciepts
  - Built and labeled a dataset and trained a multinomial logistic regression classifier on it to classify whether items were truly items or not
  - Currently familiarizing myself with Solidity to implment a way to write the receipt data to a smart contract on the blockchain
## C Project
* Created a web crawler which extracts all the URL's off of a webpage and filters out the URL's containing hrefs
  - Uses various data structures like sets, hashtables, and a bag
## C++ Project
* Created an AVLTree data structure from scratch in C++
